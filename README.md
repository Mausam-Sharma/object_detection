# Surveillance_System

It is an OpenCV based project to detect the motion. It has a security add-on to alert if motion has been detected. Whenever a foreign object is detected , an image is captured and then using the AWS Rekognition , labels are being detected in that image to tell the owner about the foreign object present in that frame , also an email is send using the AWS SNS service as an alert to the owner as well as an sms is also send on registered mobile number.
